# BlockVoteChain 

BlockVoteChain is a decentralized voting application built on blockchain technology. This repository contains all the necessary code and resources to run the BlockVoteChain application.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting:** BlockVoteChain enables decentralized voting, allowing participants to cast their votes directly without the need for intermediaries.
- **Transparent and Immutable:** All voting data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability of the voting process.
- **Security:** BlockVoteChain utilizes cryptographic techniques to ensure the security and integrity of the voting system.
- **Easy to Use:** The application provides a user-friendly interface for voters to participate in the voting process.

## Prerequisites

To run the BlockVoteChain application, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- Hardhat (development environment for Ethereum)
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)
- MetaMask (browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum network)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anj20/BlockVoteChain.git
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd BlockVoteChain
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure MetaMask:

   - Install the MetaMask extension in your browser.
   - Create a new Ethereum network and connect to it.
   - Import an account with test Ether provided by Ganache.

## Hardhat Deployment Steps

To deploy the smart contracts on a blockchain network using Hardhat, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Hardhat

If you haven't already installed Hardhat, you can do so by running:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```

### 2. Initialize Hardhat

If you haven't initialized Hardhat in your project, do so by running:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create a basic Hardhat project.

### 3. Configure Hardhat

Ensure your `hardhat.config.js` is configured correctly for the network you want to deploy to. For local development, it might look something like this:

   ```javascript
   require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');

   module.exports = {
     solidity: "0.8.0",
     networks: {
       development: {
         url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
         accounts: [`0x${YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY}`]
       }
     }
   };
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with the private key of an account you want to use for deployment.

### 4. Write Deployment Script

Create a deployment script in the `scripts` folder. For example, `deploy.js`:

   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

     console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

     const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("YourContract");
     const contract = await Contract.deploy();

     console.log("Contract deployed to address:", contract.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

   Replace `"YourContract"` with the name of your contract.

### 5. Deploy Contracts

Run the deployment script with Hardhat:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network networkname scripts/deploy.js
   ```

   This command deploys the smart contracts to the local Ganache blockchain.

## Usage

1. Start Ganache to create a local blockchain for testing and development:

   ```bash
   npx ganache-cli
   ```

2. Compile and deploy the smart contracts to the local blockchain:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network development
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the BlockVoteChain application.

5. Use MetaMask to interact with the application and cast your vote.
